Monte Carlo simulation of Multiply Scattered body and Rayleigh waves. 

.. contents::

This package will include codes for MC simulation of multiply scattered coupled body and Rayliegh waves due to perturbations on Lame parameter and density. The velocity model here is elastic, homogeneous and isotropic. 

These codes will be useful for monitoring body-wave (P/SV/SH) and Rayleigh-wave energy evoluation with time in a multiply scattering processing.

These codes are based on C language and MPI and require libgslcbas package for generating random numbers.
